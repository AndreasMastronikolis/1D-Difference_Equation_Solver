# 1D-Difference_Equation_Solver
This 'python' project computes the evolution of a one-dimensional difference equation and reveals its Cobweb plot, which is ideal for the study of the stability of cycles. For the example shown in the code, with

The script yields the two plots:

from which one can deduce that the map converges to the two-cycle -1, +1.
